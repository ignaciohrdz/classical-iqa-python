# Spatial-Spectral Entropy-base Quality (SSEQ) index

This is my implementation of the **SSEQ index**. I wasn't able to find a fully implemented Python version of this index, so I decided to use [Aca4peop's code](https://github.com/Aca4peop/SSEQ-Python) as a starting point and then add my own modifications.

The full details of SSEQ can be found in the paper: [No-reference image quality assessment based on spatial and spectral entropies (Liu et al.)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2014.06.006). The original MATLAB implementation is [here](https://github.com/utlive/SSEQ).
